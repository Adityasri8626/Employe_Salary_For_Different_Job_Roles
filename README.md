Project Overview:

The primary goal was to understand salary distributions among different job roles within the company and identify any significant trends or disparities. This required thorough data cleaning, modeling, and visualization.

Technologies Used:



ðŸ”¹ Power BI: Created dynamic and interactive dashboards for visualizing salary distributions.

ðŸ”¹ DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Employed DAX for complex calculations and to derive additional insights from the data.

ðŸ”¹ Power Query Editor: Used for efficient data cleaning and transformation, ensuring high-quality and accurate data.



Process:

Data Cleaning: Using Power Query Editor, I cleaned the raw data, handling missing values, and standardizing formats to ensure consistency.

Data Modeling: Leveraged DAX to create robust data models that facilitated deeper analysis of salary trends across different job roles.

Data Visualization: Developed interactive dashboards in Power BI, which allowed stakeholders to explore the data and gain insights through various visual representations.



ðŸ“Š Key Insights:

 Total Salary: The dashboard reveals that the total salary paid across various roles is an impressive $197 million.



- Salary Distribution by Currency: The majority of salaries are paid in USD, with significant portions also in EUR, GBP, and other currencies.



- Top Earning Roles: Principal Data Engineers, Machine Learning Managers, and Senior Data Scientists are among the top earners, highlighting the high demand and value of these roles.
